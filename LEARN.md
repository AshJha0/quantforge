# Learn QuantForge

A path through the project. Each topic goes from the plain idea, to the formal statement in a spec, to a worked example.

## Start here

QuantForge has four equal implementations of the same maths, in Java, C++, Python and Rust. None is the reference. Expected answers come from `oracle/`, because four programs agreeing proves only that they agree.

## Path for stage A

Specs are in `specifications/01-core/`. Exercises are in `program/exercises/`.

| Step | Plain idea | Read | Try |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | A year fraction depends on who is counting | `daycount.md` | EX-001 |
| 2 | Business days are rules plus surprises | `calendars.md` | Find why 2022-09-19 is a holiday |
| 3 | A rate needs its compounding | `compounding.md` | EX-002 |
| 4 | Solvers must say how they stopped | `root-finders.md` | EX-003 |
| 5 | Interpolation decides what your forwards look like | `interpolation.md` | Compare `linear` and `monotone_convex` forwards |
| 6 | Random numbers can be made reproducible | `rng.md`, `sobol.md` | Reproduce a golden case in `rng` |
| 7 | Three ways to price one option | `monte-carlo.md`, `pde.md`, `cos.md` | Price the same call all three ways |
| 8 | Never overwrite a number | `asof-store.md` | Follow a correction through the `store` cases |

## Worked examples

Each result below is real output from the CLIs on 2026-11-06. Java, C++, Python and Rust printed the same value in each one. Send the cases as `COOKBOOK.md` shows.

**Day count.** Plain idea: the same dates give different year fractions. Formal statement: `ACT_360 = days / 360`, `ACT_365F = days / 365`. From 2024-01-01 to 2024-07-01 is 182 days, and `core.daycount.year_fraction` gives 0.5055555555555555 under `ACT_360`; 182/365 is 0.49863 under `ACT_365F`. On 1,000,000 at 5%, simple interest differs by about 346 for the same dates.

**Discount factor.** Plain idea: money later is worth less than money now, by an amount set by the compounding. Formal statement: continuous compounding gives `exp(-r t)`. At `rate` 0.05 and `t` 2, `core.compounding.discount_factor` gives 0.9048374180359595.

**Calendar.** Plain idea: one-off holidays are data, not rules. `core.calendar.is_business_day` gives `false` for `GBLO` on 2022-09-19, which `calendars.md` lists as a one-off.

**Snapshot hash.** Plain idea: to prove two languages read the same input, hash one agreed spelling of it. Formal statement: `sha256` of the canonical form in `snapshot-hash.md`. `{"b":1,"a":[true,null,"x"]}` has keys sorted and its number written as binary64 hex, giving `{"a":[true,null,"x"],"b":#3ff0000000000000}` and `sha256:f44e5e9e9da8644c95ac377821cec005c5a1118e581a0d8cfb217ae01d212aed`. This is the stage A demo: the same hash in all four.

**Option price.** Plain idea: a method can be checked against a formula. For spot and strike 100, `r` 0.05, `q` 0.02, `sigma` 0.2 and `t` 1, the Black-Scholes value is 9.227006 (`oracle/REPORT.md`). `core.cos.european` with 256 terms gives 9.227005508154036, against a golden value of 9.227005508154049, inside class `fourier`. This is an analytic test on constructed inputs, not a market price.

## Validate and backtest

Stage A tests correctness with analytic, hand and outside-library answers. Later stages add calibration, backtests and new-model tests. Evidence is always labelled analytic, simulated, proxy or observed, and validation reports are self-assessment until the human review at the end of the project.
