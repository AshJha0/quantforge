# Architecture

QuantForge is one repository holding four isolated implementations and the neutral parts around them. The plain idea: a spec says what must be true, the oracle says what the answer is, and a runner that knows no finance compares each language's answer with it. Detail is in `architecture/`; decisions are in `architecture/decisions/`; diagrams are in `docs/diagrams/`.

| Part | Role | May depend on |
|---|---|---|
| `specifications/` | What must be true | Nothing |
| `oracle/` | Expected results, from outside sources and hand cases | Specs, outside libraries. Tests only |
| `datasets/` | Schemas and golden files | Oracle output |
| `conformance/` | Neutral runner and tolerances | Golden files and each CLI's JSON. No financial logic |
| `java25/`, `cpp26/`, `python/`, `rust/` | Four equal implementations | Specs only. Never each other, never the oracle |
| `tools/` | Recorder, forward log and docs site build | No financial logic |

## Rules that shape it

- No language is a reference. The oracle is the source of golden results.
- No shared code, FFI or generated maths between implementations.
- The only interface that counts is the CLI: case JSON in, result JSON out.
- Libraries first, services last. Infrastructure arrives as local adapters in stage K.
- Trading is simulated only. There are no live orders.

The specification remains a shared-error risk: four builds and a hand case can share one misreading. That is why outside libraries are used wherever a licence allows, and why a human review closes the project. Until that review, validation is self-assessment.

## Inside one implementation

Stage B adds the pricing framework (`specifications/04-pricing/pricing-framework.md`). The plain idea: terms, cashflows, market data, the model and the answer are five things, kept apart so that one can change without the others. Formally, each language separates instrument, product model, market data, pricing model and valuation result in its API; only the JSON is conformance. Use cases compose these parts and define nothing but their sums.

Stage B calculations are pure functions of their inputs, so stage F can add AD (ADR-0010). Risk is bump and rebuild for now.

Stage A built domain 01. Stage B built slices of domains 02, 03, 04, 06 and 08. Services, `infra/` and the other domains do not exist yet.
